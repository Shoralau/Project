          <p>Aedes Elysiae, a remote frontier village isolated from the world, now lives on only in cryptic legends.
Nameless hero, Khaslana, Chrysos Heir carrying the Coreflame of "Worldbearing," memorizes the ideals of all worlds, carries the fate of multitudes, and brings the first light of dawn to the new world</p>
          <p>â€”"But should dawn have never existed, let the fires of rage burn this body to ashes and transform into the blazing sun of tomorrow!"</p>

        <div id="appearance">
          <p>Phainon is a tall, well-built man with messy white hair and bright cyan eyes. On his neck, he has a brown leather choker covering a yellow mark in the shape of a sun. His outfit consists of a large, ankle-length, brown and white trench coat, with golden highlights appearing throughout. The underside of his coat is a bright yellow, visible below his waist and in his popped collar. His chest is adorned with a large golden ring, decorated with numerous golden diamonds, and his sleeves possess a floral pattern traveling down their outer sides. His right sleeve is rolled up to his bicep, exposing a brown arm guard with a golden sun emblem and two grey bracelets. On his left arm, the sleeve is rolled up to his forearm, and he instead wears a golden wrist guard and a brown fingerless glove.</p>
        <p>Phainon additionally dangles a large, lapis cap off his left shoulder, connected by a black fabric which reaches over it. He wears a large, white and gold pauldron on his right shoulder, and a leather belt running across his chest which connects it to his left. Lastly, Phainon wears black jeans, large boots, and has a black leather thigh strap.</p>
